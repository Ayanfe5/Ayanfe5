# About

A Cloud Infrastructure Engineer keen on automating processes in order to enhance software development, deployment, and maintenance.

With experience in cloud technologies such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Cloudflare, Netlify, Vercel, Heroku and Digital ocean. I have an understanding of infrastructure-as-code (IaC) using tools such as Terraform, Cloud formation, and Ansible to automate infrastructure provisioning and configuration management.

Experience implementing DevOps principles and the ability to build CI/CD pipelines using GitHub actions, bitbucket pipeline, Azure pipeline etc. I have a proven ability to troubleshoot technical issues, optimize system performance, and provide ongoing support and maintenance for systems.

I work closely with cross-functional teams, including developers, QA, and operations, to ensure a smooth software development life cycle. I also have excellent communication and problem-solving skills, making me an invaluable asset to any organization looking to build and manage cloud-based infrastructure and applications efficiently.
